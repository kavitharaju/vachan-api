A few points that comes to mind seeing the UI design
1. I assume the token occurrences are to be shown in the translation helps pane on right. It should be select-able, to facilitate context based application of senses.
2. The translation looks like a button, which I think is a text field.
3. The tokens are shown as buttons. I assume, it is meant as a list from which one item can be selected at a time, like in the old GUI
4. The senses shown as a list, is displayed for all tokens. May be it can be displayed just for the current selected token, whose order would change as per the occurrence selected from right pane. This is also fine, as long as it is readable and not too much data to be fetched in one initial token request.
5. I have a suggestion, to make the senses list select-able. Upon selecting one it will come to the translation text box which will be applied to all the selected occurences in the right pane.
6. May be we need a translate/confirm button which can be clicked to apply the translation entered in the translation text field to all the selected occurences in the right pane.
7. Another suggestion I have is to display drafts on the screen itself in real time. Not the whole book, may be just the verses where current token is occurring
